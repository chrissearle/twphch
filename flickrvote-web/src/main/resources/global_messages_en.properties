instructions.title=How to take part
instructions.instructions=<p>First you will need to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/twphch">TwPhCh on Twitter</a>. This is where \
  the challenges will be announced.</p> \
  <p>Secondly you will need to join the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/twphch/">flickr group</a>. This will require a flickr account (free) \
  and once this is set up you can use the flickr login link above to gain voting access here.</p> \
  <p>All that you need to do now is to upload images tagged #TwPhCh to the group based on the current challenge. From friday 18:00 to sunday 21:00 \
  you will be able to come here and vote for 5 photos from that weeks challenge.</p>\
  <p>We encourage you to browse everyones photos in the group and to participate both in the forums and by commenting on the photos themselves.</p>

faq.title=F.A.Q.
faq.faq=<h3>I tagged an image just before voting started and it didn't get included - why?</h3> \
  <p>Flickr presents data in two ways. One is via the flickr website www.flickr.com - the other is via \
  the flickr API. Updates to tagging (seems to be worst for changing tags on existing images but can affect \
  other things) seem to be reflected in searches via the website almost instantly - but can take up to \
  15 minutes to appear via the flickr API. There is little we can do about this other than to recommend \
  that you make sure you're ready at least 15 minutes before voting opens.</p> \
  <h3>I can't see why - my images just don't turn up</h3> \
  <p>We've had one instance of this - and it turns out that if you set up a new account - until you have \
  at least 5 images then your images simply will not be included in search results. Send the admin group a \
  mail and we'll make sure your image is added.</p>
